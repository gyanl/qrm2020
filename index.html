         <h1 class="text-dark"><a class="no-decorate" name="who">Who should attend?</a></h1>
         <p class="text-dark">This course is for you if you are:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>An industry professional such as an interaction designer, user experience researcher, product manager or user interface designer with little formal exposure to quantitative HCI research.</li>
            <li>An aspirant for a PhD programme or a current PhD student in HCI who does not have enough exposure to quantitative research methods</li>
            <li>A faculty member in a design school who would like to teach courses on topics such as design research methods.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The course has two main goals. Firstly, it gives participants an exposure to basic theoretical concepts in conducting quantitative studies and performing statistical analysis. Secondly, it gives participants some practice with running quantitative studies. After attending the course, participants should be able to design rigorous quantitative research studies / experiments, conduct them, analyse the findings statistically and report them precisely.</p>
